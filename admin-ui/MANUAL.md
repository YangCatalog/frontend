### running scripts

In all the following scripts to track the job status check the right hand side of actions tab.
With each of the running script by you the job id is generated and tracked with its status which
can be done, in progress or failed.

If we are missing some of the modules and we are sure that they are provided in yangModels/yang
github repository we need to run script to populate them manually. 

1. sign in to yangcatalog admin page
2. select actions tab
3. from drop down menu choose populate
4. in options change only dir value to `/var/yang/nonietf/yangmodels/yang/` + directory from the
 yangmodels/yang repository. (E.g. ietf RFCs would be `/var/yang/nonietf/yangmodels/yang/standard/ietf/RFC`)
5. in options check the notify indexing checkbox
6. in options check the sdo option if you want all the yang modules to be populated or do not check if
you want to validate all the modules based on xml hello message from within the directory
7. hit execute and track the job

If draft pull job failed and you don t see any bug or apparent reason for this you can rerun this job

is reponsible to make sure this will be executed. To do so he follows these steps:

1. sign in to yangcatalog admin page

If we are unable to load any of the module in yangcatalog.org the confd database is most likely empty.
This should never happen in any case. This needs to be reported immediately (or github issue opened). To
load all the modules from last saved cache (which is done on daily basis), you follow these steps:

## yc_admin

Admin is responsible for all of the yc_operator tasks as well as for the following tasks.

### updating config file

If we change any of the passwords to databases or any of the links that come from yangcatalog
config file admin is responsible to keep the config file updated as well. To do so he follows
these instructions:

1. sign in to yangcatalog admin page
2. select config tab
3. hit edit button
4. make appropriate changes
5. hit save
6. confirm

These changes will take effect immediately after confirmation therefore please make sure that the
changes you have made are valid otherwise it may have critical impact on yangcatalog functionality.

### Unable to index

Only one indexing can run at the time which will prevent from wrong data submitting to elasticsearch.
While the indexing is running a lock file is created in temp folder of yangcatalog. This should exist
only while the indexing is running. If the job is done or failed and the lock file was not removed for
some reason we need to make sure it will be removed manually. To make sure that job is done follow these
steps:

1. sign in to yangcatalog admin page
2. select files tab
3. wait until loaded
4. click tmp folder
5. find rest-of-elk-date.json and make sure this has size of 2B
6. if it has more let the job run or check if it did not fail
7. if it has 2B job is done follow next steps

To remove lock file follow these steps:

1. sign in to yangcatalog admin page
2. select files tab
3. wait until loaded
4. click tmp folder
5. find any of the *.lock file
6. remove it using the trash can symbol (this can be find at the end of the selected file)
7. confirm

To find out if the job failed follow these steps.

1. sign in to yangcatalog admin page
2. select log tab
3. from drop down menu choose process-changed-mods
4. if log message `No new modules are added or removed. Exiting script!!!` and log message 
`Initializing script loading config parameters` is repeated in this order for over 20 times,
it has been failed and is not running.

Other option how to check for the job running is to go directly to webserver using ssh and conect
to the yc_search container and list for all the jobs running using `ps -aux` and search for
process-changed-mods.
