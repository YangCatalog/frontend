This repository contains the code for displaying and formating of most of YANG Catalog's public web pages. This includes:
- informational pages
- [statistics page](https://yangcatalog.org/private-page) - displays various graphs, statistics, and warnings for module compilations
- [search page](https://yangcatalog.org/yang-search) - plain text or regexp search through the catalog of YANG modules
- [module details page](https://yangcatalog.org/yang-search/module_details) - view details and properties of a specific module
- [module impact analysis page](https://yangcatalog.org/yang-search/impact_analysis) - view dependency relations of a module or set of modules

The statistics data displayed is generated by [sdo-analysis](https://github.com/YangCatalog/sdo_analysis).

The rest of the data is provided by the [backend](https://github.com/YangCatalog/backend).

## Technical information
YANG Catalog's frontend is written in Angular and TypeScript.

The docker container is meant to be deployed with docker-compose or k8s as part of a full YANG Catalog instance with the [deployment](https://github.com/yang-catalog/deployment) repository.

## Debugging Angular application in VS Code
If you use VS Code as IDE, the debugging configuration is already created.
- First you need to install [JavaScript Debugger (Nightly)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.js-debug-nightly) extensions
- Start Angular application with command npm start - application runs on http://localhost:4200
- Select debug configuration and run it

Then you should be able to place breakpoint anywhere in the code.
